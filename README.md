# Supercon9-Googly
Googly-eye app for the Hackaday Supercon 9 Badge

Add as an app (in place of e.g. UserA) on the main.py on the badge and point to this code.

I'm not proud of this code, but as there are zero examples of how to do animations on lvgl in micropython, it seemed liked a good idea to spin this up, so others might be able to avoid my pain.

There's a tremendous amount of improvements to be made to this code - it's currently at the 'yes, it works' stage.
